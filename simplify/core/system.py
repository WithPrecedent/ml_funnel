    """Base class for siMpLify project stages.

    A 'SimpleSystem' maintains a progress state stored in the attribute
    'stage'. The 'stage' corresponds to whether one of the core workflow
    methods has been called. The string stored in 'stage' can then be used by
    instances to alter instance behavior, call methods, or change access
    method functionality.

    Args:
        name (Optional[str]): designates the name of the class instance used
            for internal referencing throughout siMpLify. If the class
            instance needs settings from the shared 'Idea' instance, 'name'
            should match the appropriate section name in that 'Idea' instance.
            When subclassing, it is a good idea to use the same 'name' attribute
            as the base class for effective coordination between siMpLify
            classes. Defaults to None or __class__.__name__.lower().
        stages (Optional[List[str]]): list of recognized states which correspond
            to methods within a class instance. Defaults to ['initialize',
            'draft', 'publish', 'apply'].
        auto_advance (Optional[bool]): whether to automatically advance 'stage'
            when one of the stage methods is called (True) or whether 'stage'
            must be changed manually by using the 'advance' method. Defaults to
            True.
